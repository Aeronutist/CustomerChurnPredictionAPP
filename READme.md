\# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction – Telecom Sector (ML Project)

Predict whether a customer will leave the telecom service (churn) using machine learning models like Logistic Regression and XGBoost.

\---

\## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn costs companies millions in lost revenue. In this project, we:

\- Explored the Telco Customer Churn dataset

\- Performed data cleaning, encoding, and scaling

\- Trained Logistic Regression and XGBoost models

\- Evaluated performance using precision, recall, F1-score

\- Saved the best model for deployment

\---

\## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

| Model | Accuracy | Highlights |

|--------------------|----------|----------------------------------------|

| Logistic Regression| ~82% | Simple, interpretable baseline |

| XGBoost Classifier | ~86–88% | Best performer on recall & F1-score |

✅ \*\*XGBoost selected for final deployment\*\*
